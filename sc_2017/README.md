Overcoming Load Imbalance for Irregular Sparse Matrices
=======================================================
In this paper we propose a load-balanced GPU kernel for computing the sparse
matrix vector (SpMV) product. Making heavy use of the latest GPU programming
features, we also enable satisfying performance for irregular and unbalanced
matrices. In a performance comparison using 400 test matrices we reveal the new
kernel being superior to the most popular SpMV implementations.
